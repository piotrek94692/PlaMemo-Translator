# FAQ

## How to launch the app?
1. Install the [latest version of Python](https://www.python.org/downloads)
2. Launch `translator.py`

## What OS's does it support?
**Windows** - it's the target OS, and the app should run without any problems on it<br>
**Linux** - many people use Linux, so it's also high priority, but you should expect some issues<br>
**MacOS** - extra support, expect issues, **we recommend using Windows or Linux instead**

## The app crashes! Something doesn't work!
Although the app is 100% working under certain conditions,<br>
you might encounter crashes or certain features might not work.<br>
That can happen because of your OS, Python version, installed modules, and more.
