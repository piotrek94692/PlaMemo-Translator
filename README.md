# FAQ

## How to launch the app?

### From source code
1. Install the [latest version of Python](https://www.python.org/downloads) (we are currently targeting Python 3.10.*)
2. Launch `translator.py`

### Binary version for Windows
1. Launch `translator.exe`

## Does it work with any other Kaleido ADV Workshop games? What about the PS Vita version of PlaMemo?
It might work on other games, and also on other platforms, when we'll verify that it works, the tool will be rebranded and PlaMemo branding will be optional.

## What OS's does it support?
**Windows 8 or higher** - it's the target OS, and the app should run without any problems on it<br>
**Linux** - many people use Linux, so it's also high priority, but you should expect some issues<br>
**MacOS 10.11 or higher** (didn't test, but it probably won't run on lower than this) - extra support, expect issues, **we recommend using Windows or Linux instead**

## The app crashes! Something doesn't work!
Although the app is 100% working under certain conditions,<br>
you might encounter crashes or certain features might not work.<br>
That can happen because of your OS, Python version, installed modules, and more.

Please report all crashes & bugs on the Issues tab, or add me on Discord: `PIESEL#8040`

## Can I customize the app?
Yes! Check out the `howtoconfigure.txt` file!

## How do I hide the log window?
Change `translator.py` to `translator.pyw`

## Are you planning to update to PyQt6?
No, PyQt6 is missing some useful features.

## What features are planned?
- Console commands
- Text preview window
- Automatic character name replacer
- Jumping back/forward by a certain amount of lines
- DeepL translator
- And more!
